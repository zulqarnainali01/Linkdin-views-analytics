## Introduction

LinkedIn provides limited content analytics, focusing primarily on individual post metrics. However, users often desire a broader perspective on their posts' performance, encompassing metrics like likes, views, and comments over a longer period. This README introduces a Python program designed to address this need by visualizing trends in post views over recent days.

## Solution Overview

This Python program utilizes Selenium, a portable framework for testing web applications, to navigate LinkedIn and extract relevant data. By analyzing the views of posts over time, users can gain insights into their content's performance trends.

## How to Use

To utilize this program effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries, particularly Selenium.
   
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the Python script provided in the notebook or download and run it locally.

3. **Input LinkedIn Credentials:** Provide your LinkedIn username and password when prompted to access the desired data.

4. **Review Results:** Once the program completes its execution, review the generated visualizations to analyze post view trends.
